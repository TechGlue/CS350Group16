# Group 16 Repository!
Hi! This is the home to the Group 16 final project repository for CSCD 350 Software Development Principles. The Goal of this group project was to get an understanding of what it takes to plan, learn and execute a project in a team. Our task was to create a parser that'd take in commands and execute the proper functions in the .jar file that was provided by the instructor.
